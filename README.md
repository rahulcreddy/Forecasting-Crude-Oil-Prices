# Forecasting Crude Oil Prices

Crude Oil price fluctuations seems to be a strong indicator of the current market conditions. During Covid-19, crude oil prices went down to as low as 10$ per barrel resulting from very little demand in the market, and later shot up as economies re-opened globally. Also, the Russia-Ukraine war led the crude oil prices spike up to 110$ per barrel in 2022. Hence, I believe accurately forecasting the crude oil prices helps evaluate the future macroeconomic environment. This being said, as crude oil prices fluctuate depending on the economic factors, this would make the forecasting difficult and problematic to predict.
